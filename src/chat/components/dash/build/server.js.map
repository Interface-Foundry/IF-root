<p>Dont want your columns to simply stack in smaller devices? Use the extra small and\n              medium device grid classes by adding <code>.col-xs-*</code> <code>.col-md-*</code> to\n              your columns. See the example below for a better idea of how it all works.\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"row show-grid\">\n              <div className=\"col-xs-12 col-md-8\">.col-xs-12 .col-md-8</div>\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-md-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-md-4</div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"row show-grid\">\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-md-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-md-4</div>\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-md-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-md-4</div>\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-md-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-md-4</div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"row show-grid\">\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6\">.col-xs-6</div>\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6\">.col-xs-6</div>\n            </div>\n          </Panel>\n\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"row\">\n        <div className=\"col-lg-12\">\n\n          <Panel>\n            <h3>Example: Mobile, tablet, desktops</h3>\n            <p>Build on the previous example by creating even more dynamic and powerful\n              layouts with tablet <code>.col-sm-*</code> classes.</p>\n            <div className=\"row show-grid\">\n              <div className=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8\">.col-xs-12 .col-sm-6 .col-md-8</div>\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-md-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-md-4</div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"row show-grid\">\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-sm-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-sm-4</div>\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-sm-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-sm-4</div>\n              <div className=\"clearfix visible-xs\" />\n              <div className=\"col-xs-6 col-sm-4\">.col-xs-6 .col-sm-4</div>\n            </div>\n          </Panel>\n\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"row\">\n        <div className=\"col-lg-12\">\n\n          <Panel>\n            <h3 id=\"grid-responsive-resets\">Responsive column resets</h3>\n            <p>With the four tiers of grids available you're bound to run into issues where, at\n              certain breakpoints, your columns don't clear quite right as one is taller than the\n              other.
