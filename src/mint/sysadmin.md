hello sysadmin, you have much work to do.

# Overview

Databases

* mongodb-beta: used for slack and mint
* mongodb-server: used for facebook

Slack stuff runs on a kubernetes cluster

Mint stuff does not, because we're still iterating hard and fast and using k8s for development is still kind of like tying a cherry stem with your tongue, it can be done but you can't really see what you're doing and it's really only a party trick.
