Therefore, we have created this Privacy Policy so that you know how we use and disclose your information when you make it available to us. The Privacy Policy below discloses our practices regarding information collection and usage for the website located at http://kipthis.com, http://kipsearch.com and the Kip applications (collectively, the <strong>"Services"</strong>).

          
          By using or accessing the Service or participating in our services, you signify your agreement to be bound by our Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE OUR SERVICE OR PARTICIPATE IN OUR SERVICES.



          Key aspects of our privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy include the following explanations:

          </ul>

          <strong>Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect:</strong>
          We do not collect personally identifiable information from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us, such as your email address, username and/or name. You may be required to submit certain personally identifiable information when you register on the Service. The personally identifiable information which you may provide to us could include your name, email address, phone number, physical address, credit card number and related information, and other personal information.
          


          <strong>Non-Personal Or Aggregate Information That We Collect:</strong>
          When you access or use our Service, we may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information from you, such as IP host address, web pages viewed, browser type, operating system, referring service, search information, device type, page views, usage and browsing habits on the Service and similar data. We may also aggregate demographic information collected from our users (such as the number of users in a particular state) in a manner which does not identify any one individual. We may also aggregate information collected offline in connection with the Service or use of our services, obtain non-personally identifiable information from third party sources and develop aggregate information by anonymizing previously collected personally identifiable information.
          
          It is possible at times when collecting non-personally identifiable information through automatic means that we may unintentionally collect or receive personally identifiable information that is mixed in with the non-personally identifiable information.

The information generated by these services about your use of the Service (including your IP address or a truncated version of your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by analytics service providers on their servers. Those service providers will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your, and other users, use of the Service, compiling reports for us on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage.

          We may collect information about your computer, including your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and in order to create reports. This is statistical data about our users browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.
          
          We use cookies on our site for Google Analytics. Google Analytics is a web analytics tool that helps website owners understand how visitors engage with their website. Google Analytics customers can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with their website so that they can improve it.
          
          Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track visitor interactions as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how visitors use our site. We then use the information to compile reports and to help us improve our site.

          Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. These cookies are used to store information, such as the time that the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before and what site referred the visitor to the web page.



          Google Analytics collects information anonymously. It reports website trends without identifying individual visitors.

Location data may convey to us information about how you browse or use the Service. Location data does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you. Location data may be used in conjunction with personally identifiable information. Some features of the Service, particularly any location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.

          <strong>Device Identifiers:</strong>
          When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more device identifiers. Device identifiers are small data files or other, similar data structures stored on, or otherwise associated with, your mobile device. These device identifiers uniquely identify your mobile device and are used to enhance the Service. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us.

          The security of your personally identifiable information is very important to us. When we collect your personally identifiable information online, we use reasonable efforts to protect it from unauthorized access. We use commercially reasonable efforts to encrypt and anonymize your data so that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized third parties. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that your personally identifiable information will be completely free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use of our Service demonstrates your assumption of this risk.
          
          We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to perform their duties are authorized to have access to your personally identifiable information.

Any such content, or metadata about such content, may be viewed by other users. You should be aware that personally identifiable information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, social media platform or otherwise online, or that you share in an open forum such as an in-person panel or survey, may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We are unable to control such uses of your personally identifiable information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the personally identifiable information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for any number of purposes.

If at any time in the future we plan to collect personally identifiable information from children under 13, such collection and use, to the extent applicable, shall, when required, be done in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and appropriate consent from the child's parent or guardian will be sought where required by COPPA. When we become aware that personally identifiable information from a child under 13 has been collected without such child's parent or guardian's consent, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.

          <strong>
          Other Services:</strong>

          We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this Privacy Policy at any time.

Your continued use of the Service and our services following the posting of any changes to this Privacy Policy means you accept such changes.

            <li>not to harass, annoy, intimidate or threaten any Kip employees or agents engaged in providing any portion of Kip's services;</li>

            <li>not to display an advertisement, or accept payment or anything of value from a third person in exchange for your performing any commercial activity on or through the Sites or Kip's services on behalf of that person, such as posting blogs or bulletins with a commercial purpose;</li>

            <li>not to upload or transmit viruses or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files;</li>
            <li>
          not to disrupt, interfere with, or otherwise harm or violate the security of the Sites, or any services, system resources, accounts, passwords, servers or networks connected to or accessible through the Sites or affiliated or linked sites (including those of our restaurant partners); and

          </ul>

          

          


          You agree that the consequences of commercial use or re-publication of User Content or Materials from the Sites or other violations of the foregoing proscriptions may be so serious and incalculable that monetary compensation may not be a sufficient or appropriate remedy and that Kip will be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief to prohibit such use or activity, without the need to prove damages.
          

          <strong>II. Content You Provide</strong>
          Kip may provide you with interactive opportunities on the Sites, including, without limitation, features such as user ratings and reviews, saved favorites, liked items and bookmarked retailers, vendors, products and/or restaurants (collectively, <strong>"Interactive Areas"</strong>). You represent and warrant that you are the owner of and/or otherwise have the right to provide all information, comments, reviews, ratings and/or other materials and/or content that you submit, post and/or otherwise transmit to the Sites (<strong>"User Content"</strong>).

          <strong>III. Use of Your Content</strong>
          You grant Kip an irrevocable, transferable, paid up, royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive worldwide sub-licensable license to use, copy, display, publish, modify, remove, publicly perform, translate, create derivative works from, distribute and/or otherwise use User Content in connection with Kip's business and in all forms of media now known or hereafter invented (collectively, the "Uses"), without notification to and/or approval by you. You further grant Kip a license to use your username and/or other user profile information, including without limitation, your ratings history and how long you have been a Kip shopper, to attribute User Content to you in connection with the Uses, if we choose to do so, again without notification to and/or approval by you. Further, if you provide any suggestions, input or other feedback relating to the Sites or the services we provide, Kip shall have the right to freely and fully exercise and exploit such content in connection with its business, without notice to, approval by or compensation to you.


          User Content transmitted to certain parts of the Sites, including, without limitation, restaurant pages and certain Interactive Areas, may be posted in public areas on our Sites, including without limitation in a compilation format, and as such will be publicly visible and accessible. Kip and its officers, directors, employees, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, licensors, licensees, designees, business partners, contractors, agents and representatives (collectively, the "Released Parties") will not be responsible for, and you hereby expressly release the Released Parties from, any and all liability for the action of any and all third parties with respect to User Content.

          <strong>IV. Conduct within Interactive Areas</strong>
          By transmitting User Content, you agree to follow the standards of conduct below, and any additional standards that may be stated on the Sites.
          We do our best to encourage civility and discourage disruptive communication on the Sites. We also discourage communications that incite others to violate our standards. We expect your cooperation in upholding our standards. You are responsible for all of your User Content. You agree not to provide any User Content that:

          <ul>

            <li>is unlawful, harmful to adults or minors, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, offensive, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, and/or racially, ethnically and/or otherwise objectionable;</li>

            <li>has a commercial, political or religious purpose;</li>
            <li>
          is false, misleading and/or not written in good faith;</li>

            <li>infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of privacy and/or publicity, and/or other proprietary rights of any person and/or entity;</li>

            <li>is illegal and/or promotes illegal activity;</li>

            <li>contains unauthorized advertising and/or solicits users to a business other than those on the Sites; and/or
          is intended to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality or integrity of any computer software, hardware or Materials on the Sites or other websites.</li></ul>



          Kip may monitor any and all use of the Sites; however, we are under no obligation to do so. We may manage the Sites in a manner intended to protect our property and rights and to facilitate the proper functioning of the Sites. If any User Content or conduct on our Sites violates our standards, or any other terms and conditions of this Agreement; or interferes with other peoples' enjoyment of the Materials or our Sites; or that we believe is inappropriate; in our sole judgment, we reserve the right to change, delete or remove, in part or in full, any such User Content or Materials; and we further reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to any Interactive Areas or any Sites. Kip will cooperate with local, state and/or federal authorities to the extent required by applicable law in connection with User Content.
          



          <strong>V. Ratings and Reviews</strong>
          The Sites and related retailer partner sites may allow you to rate and post reviews of products, vendors, restaurants and other businesses (<strong>"Ratings and Reviews"</strong>). Such Ratings and Reviews are considered User Content and are governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, your agreement regarding your use of Interactive Areas and the Sites' standards of conduct. Ratings and Reviews are not endorsed by Kip, and do not represent the views of Kip or of any affiliate or partner of Kip. Kip does not assume liability for Ratings and Reviews or for any claims, liabilities or losses resulting from any Ratings and Reviews. We strive to maintain a high level of integrity with our Ratings and Reviews and other User Content. Therefore, all Ratings and Reviews must comply with the following criteria: (1) before posting a Rating or Review, you must have had first-hand experience with the restaurant; (2) you may not have a proprietary or other affiliation with either the restaurant or any of its competitors; (3) you may not draw any legal conclusions regarding the restaurants' products, services or conduct; and (4) your review must otherwise comply with the terms of this Agreement. Any Rating and/or Review that we determine, in our sole discretion, could diminish the integrity of the Ratings and Reviews, the Materials and/or the Sites may be removed or excluded by us without notice.


          <strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>
          THE SITES, THE MATERIALS AND ALL OTHER CONTENT ON THE SITES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE RELEASED PARTIES DISCLAIM, WITH RESPECT TO THE MATERIALS AND ALL OTHER CONTENT ON THE SITES, ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. KIP DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SITES, THE MATERIALS AND/OR THE OTHER CONTENT ON THE SITES WILL BE SECURE, UNINTERRUPTED AND/OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, AND/OR THAT THE SITES, THE MATERIALS AND/OR OTHER CONTENT ON THE SITES ARE FREE FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. Kip DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE SITES, THE MATERIALS AND/OR ANY OTHER CONTENT ON THE SITES IN TERMS OF THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, CURRENTNESS, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE QUALITY AND/OR TIMING OF A DELIVERY ORDERED ON THE SITES AND/OR THE FOOD OR OTHER PRODUCTS DELIVERED. YOU (AND NOT Kip) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE SITES, THE MATERIALS AND/OR OTHER CONTENT ON THE SITES. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT FULLY APPLY TO YOU. THIS EXCLUSION IS ENFORCEABLE IN NEW JERSEY.

          <strong>
          LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong>
          IN NO EVENT SHALL Kip BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (EVEN IF KIP HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), IN A WARRANTY, CONTRACT, OR NEGLIGENCE ACTION THAT IN ANY MANNER ARISES OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, PERFORMANCE OF, OR SERVICES PROVIDED ON OR THROUGH THE SITES. Kip ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY AND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO, OR VIRUSES THAT MAY INFECT YOUR COMPUTER EQUIPMENT OR OTHER PROPERTY ON ACCOUNT OF YOUR ACCESS TO, USE OF, BROWSING OF, OR DOWNLOADING OF ANY MATERIAL FROM THE SITES. Kip ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY IN ANY MANNER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, OR MATERIAL AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITES, AS WELL AS ANY THIRD PARTY WEBSITE PAGES OR ADDITIONAL WEBSITES LINKED TO THIS SITE, FOR ANY ERROR, DEFAMATION, LIBEL, SLANDER, OMISSION, FALSEHOOD, OBSCENITY, PORNOGRAPHY, PROFANITY, DANGER, INACCURACY CONTAINED THEREIN OR HARM TO PERSON OR PROPERTY CAUSED THEREBY. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. IN NO EVENT SHALL Kip'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION, WHETHER IN WARRANTY, CONTRACT, OR NEGLIGENCE EXCEED (A) THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO Kip OR A Kip'S RESTAURANT, IF ANY, OR (B) $1000 (WHICHEVER IS LESS). BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS LIMITATION IS ENFORCEABLE IN NEW JERSEY.

          
          YOU AND KIP AGREE THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE MATERIAL, BARGAINED-FOR BASES OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN DETERMINING THE CONSIDERATION TO BE GIVEN BY EACH PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE DECISION BY EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. YOU AND Kip AGREE THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THESE TERMS OF USE ARE FAIR AND REASONABLE.


          IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE SITE OR DO NOT AGREE TO ANY PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS OF USE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SITE, EXCEPT AS MAY BE OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR IN THIS SECTION.

          <h2>THIRD PARTY LINKS</h2>


          The Sites may contain links to websites that are owned, controlled, developed, sponsored and/or maintained by third parties and which may be subject to additional terms and conditions (<strong>"Third Party Websites"</strong>).

          <strong>CHANGES TO THE AGREEMENT</strong>
          We may change this Agreement from time to time and without prior notice. If we make a change to this Agreement, it will be effective as soon as we post it, and the most current version of this Agreement will always be posted under the "Terms of Use" tab (<strong>"Updated Terms"</strong>). If we make a material change to the Agreement, we may notify you. You agree that you will review this Agreement periodically. By continuing to access and/or use the Sites after we post Updated Terms, you agree to be bound by the Updated Terms, and if you do not agree to the Updated Terms, you will stop using the Sites. This Agreement will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.


          <strong>GOVERNING LAW</strong>
          You acknowledge and agree that your access to and/or use of the Sites, the Materials and other content on the Sites is subject to all applicable international, federal, state and local laws and regulations. The terms, conditions and policies contained in this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.


          <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>


          <strong>I. Arbitration</strong>
          You agree that all claims, disputes or disagreements that may arise out of the interpretation or performance of this Agreement, or that in any way relate to your use of the Sites, the Materials and/or other content on the Sites, shall be submitted exclusively to binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. Arbitration means that an arbitrator and not a judge or jury will decide the claim. Rights to prehearing exchange of information and appeals may also be limited in arbitration. You acknowledge and agree that you and Kip are each waiving the right to a trial by jury. You further acknowledge and agree that you waive your right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Kip otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms of Use. You further acknowledge that any claim arising under this Agreement will be brought within one year of its accrual or it will be waived.


          <strong>II. Arbitration Rules</strong>
          The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/aaa/ShowProperty?nodeId=/UCM/ADRSTAGE2021425& or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.


          <strong>III. Arbitration Process</strong>
          A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at https://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased and a separate affidavit for waiver of fees for California residents only at https://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=ADRSTG_004304&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased .) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the county in which you reside and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.


          <strong>IV. Arbitration Location and Procedure</strong>
          Unless you and Kip otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Kip submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.


          <strong>V. Arbitrator's Decision</strong>
          The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration, you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law. Kip will not seek, and hereby waives all rights Kip may have under applicable law to recover attorneys' fees and expenses if Kip prevails in arbitration.


          <strong>VI. Fees</strong>
          Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $25,000, Kip will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).


          <strong>VII. Changes</strong>
          Kip reserves the right to change this "Dispute Resolution" section, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of such amendment. Notwithstanding the provisions of the modification-related provisions above, if Kip changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Sites after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree to such change, you may reject any such change by providing Kip written notice of such rejection by mail or hand delivery to: Kip, Attn: Dispute Resolutions, 122 W 27th street Fl 10 New York NY 10001, or by email from the email address associated with your account to: hello@kipthis.com with the email subject as DISPUTE RESOLUTIONS, within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Effective" date above. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this "Dispute Resolution" section. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Kip in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement, as applicable).


          <strong>WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY</strong>
          Any waiver by Kip of any provision of this Agreement must be in writing. If any portion of this Agreement is found to be void, invalid or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that matches the intent of the original provision as closely as possible. The remainder of this Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to terms contained herein.
