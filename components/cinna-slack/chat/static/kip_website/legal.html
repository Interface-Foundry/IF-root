        <b>INTERFACE FOUNDRY PBC PRIVACY POLICY</b>
        <br><br>

Interface Foundry PBC located at 902 Broadway 6F, New York, NY 10010 (“Interface Foundry”, “we”, “us”, or "our") recognizes the importance of your personal privacy.  Therefore, we have created this Privacy Policy so that you know how we use and disclose your information when you make it available to us.  The Privacy Policy below discloses our practices regarding information collection and usage for the web site located at www.interfacefoundry.com, the website located at http://kipthis.com, http://kipsearch.com and the Kip applications (collectively, the “Service”).
<br><br>

By using or accessing the Service or participating in our services, you signify your agreement to be bound by our Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE OUR SERVICE OR PARTICIPATE IN OUR SERVICES.

<br><br>
Key aspects of our privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy include the following explanations:<br>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
<li>The information we collect and why we collect it;</li>
<li>How we use that information;</li>
<li>How we share information; and</li>
<li>The choices we offer.</li></ul>

<b>Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect:</b> <br>
We do not collect personally identifiable information from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us, such as your email address or name. You may be required to submit certain personally identifiable information when you register on the Service. The personally identifiable information which you may provide to us could include your name, email address, phone number, physical address, credit card number and related information, and other personal information.
<br><br>
<b>Non-Personal Or Aggregate Information That We Collect:</b><br>
When you access or use our Service, we may automatically collect non-personally identifiable
information from you, such as IP host address, web pages viewed, browser type, operating
system, referring service, search information, device type, page views, usage and browsing
habits on the Service and similar data. We may also aggregate demographic information
collected from our users (such as the number of users in a particular state) in a manner
which does not identify any one individual. We may also aggregate information collected
offline in connection with the Service or use of our services, obtain non-personally identifiable
information from third party sources and develop aggregate information by anonymizing
previously collected personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
It is possible at times when collecting non-personally identifiable information through automatic means that we may unintentionally collect or receive personally identifiable information that is mixed in with the non-personally identifiable information.  While we will make reasonable efforts to prevent such incidental data collection, the possibility still exists.  If you believe that we have inadvertently collected your personal information, please notify us at hello@interfacefoundry.com.
<br><br>

<b>Information Usage:</b><br>
We will only use your personally identifiable information as described below, unless you have specifically consented to another type of use, either at the time the personally identifiable information is collected from you or through some other form of consent from you or notification to you: 
<br>
• We may share your personally identifiable information collected in connection with providing the Service.
<br><br>
• We may use your personally identifiable information to respond to your inquires or requests.
<br><br>
• We may use your personally identifiable information to send you emails from time to time about our services, but we will not provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for them to contact you directly unless otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy or you provide your consent.
<br><br>
• We may permit our vendors and subcontractors to access your personally identifiable information, but they are only permitted to do so in connection with performing services for us.  They are not authorized by us to use the information for their own benefit.
<br><br>
• We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties to further the purpose for which you provided such information to us; for example, but without limitation, we may share your information with our email platform provider, as necessary for sending and receiving emails to and from you. <b>Whenever possible, we urge you to read the privacy policies of any third party before submitting information through our Service.</b>
<br><br>
• We may disclose personally identifiable information as required by law or legal process.
<br><br>
• We may disclose personally identifiable information to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, or the terms or policies for our services or our sponsors.
<br><br>
• We may transfer your personally identifiable information in connection with the sale or merger or change of control of Interface Foundry or the division responsible for the services with which your personally identifiable information is associated.
<br><br>
• We may share your personally identifiable information with an affiliate of Interface Foundry who is in the same corporate family as us as long as their privacy practices are substantially similar to ours.
<br><br>
• We may share your personally identifiable information with an approved third party if during the use of the service you become eligible for a promotion with that approved third party. 
<br><br>
Non- personally identifiable or aggregate information may be used by us for any purposes permitted by law and may be shared with any number of parties, provided that such information shall not specifically identify you. 
<br><br>

<b>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</b><br>
“Cookies” are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a service for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with that service. Many services use cookies for these purposes.  We may use cookies (and similar items such as clear gifs, web beacons, tags, etc.) on our Service to customize your visit and for other purposes to make your visit more convenient or to enable us to enhance our Service.  We may also use and place cookies (and similar items) on your computer from our third party service providers in connection with the Service, such as an analytics provider that helps us manage and analyze Service usage, as described more fully below.  In addition, our advertisers and business partners may set cookies and similar items on your computer when you use our Service.  You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or flush them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences, in which case you may still use our Service, but it may interfere with some of its functionality. Cookies and similar items are not used by us to automatically retrieve personally identifiable information from your computer without your knowledge.
<br><br>
In addition, our advertisers and business partners
may set cookies and similar items on your computer when you use our Service. You may stop or
restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or flush them from your browser by
adjusting your web browser preferences, in which case you may still use our Service, but it may
interfere with some of its functionality. Cookies and similar items are not used by us to
automatically retrieve personally identifiable information from your computer without your
knowledge.
<br><br>
If you delete your cookies, change browsers or use a different cookie, our cookie (or an opt-out cookie) may no longer work and you will have to reinput (or opt-out) again.
<br><br>

<b>Analytics and Conversion Tracking:</b><br>
We use analytics services that use cookies, javascript and similar technologies to help us analyze how users use the Service. The information generated by these services about your use of the Service (including your IP address or a truncated version of your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by analytics service providers on their servers. Those service providers will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your, and other users’, use of the Service, compiling reports for us on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. 
<br><br>
We may collect information about your computer, including your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and in order to create reports. This is statistical data about our users’ browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. 
<br><br>
We use cookies on our site for Google Analytics. Google Analytics is a web analytics tool that helps website owners understand how visitors engage with their website. Google Analytics customers can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with their website so that they can improve it. 
<br><br>
Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track visitor interactions as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how visitors use our site. We then use the information to compile reports and to help us improve our site. 
<br><br>
Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. These cookies are used to store information, such as the time that the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before and what site referred the visitor to the web page. 
<br><br>
Google Analytics collects information anonymously. It reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our site – for more information on opting out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you use, visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
<br><br>
We also use Google conversion tracking and/or similar services to help us understand your and other users’ use of the Service.
<br><br>
Please see https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/1722022?hl=en for more information about conversion tracking provided by Google.
<br><br>

<b>Geo-Location Information:</b><br> 
When you access or use the Service, Interface Foundry may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (including but not limited to latitude and/or longitude), IP addresses, and/or similar information regarding the actual location of your device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse or use the Service. Location data does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you. Location data may be used in conjunction with personally identifiable information. Some features of the Service, particularly any location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.  
<br><br>
Additionally, when you access or use the Service, Interface Foundry may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “time data,” which may include information indicating the date and time that your device was present in a given location. Time data may convey to us information about how you browse or use the Service. Time data does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you. Time data may be used in conjunction with personally identifiable information. Some features of the Service, particularly any time-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled. 
<br><br>
<b>Device Identifiers: </b><br>
When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or other, similar data structures stored on, or otherwise associated with, your mobile device. These device identifiers uniquely identify your mobile device and are used to enhance the Service. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us. A device identifier may convey to us information about how you use the Service. A device identifier does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you. A device identifier may, however, be used in conjunction with personally identifiable information. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers are impaired or disabled. Interface Foundry may access, collect and/or store device identifiers upon enabling Interface Foundry’s Services.
<br><br>

<b>Security:</b><br>
The security of your personally identifiable information is very important to us. When we collect your personally identifiable information online, we use reasonable efforts to protect it from unauthorized access.  We use commercially reasonable efforts to encrypt and anonymize your data so that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized third parties. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that your personally identifiable information will be completely free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use of our Service demonstrates your assumption of this risk.  
<br><br>
We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to perform their duties are authorized to have access to your personally identifiable information. For more information on protecting your privacy, please visit www.ftc.gov/privacy.
<br><br>

<b>Your Disclosures:</b><br>
You may upload or otherwise share content on the Service or on a third-party site, including social media platforms and chat rooms. Any such content, or metadata about such content, may be viewed by other users.  You should be aware that personally identifiable information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, social media platform or otherwise online, or that you share in an open forum such as an in-person panel or survey, may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions.  We are unable to control such uses of your personally identifiable information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the personally identifiable information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for any number of purposes. <b>We urge you to read the privacy practices of any social media platform before uploading or posting any content to said platform.</b>
<br><br>

<b>Protection for Children:</b><br>
We generally do not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.  If at any time in the future we plan to collect personally identifiable information from children under 13, such collection and use, to the extent applicable, shall, when required, be done in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and appropriate consent from the child’s parent or guardian will be sought where required by COPPA.  When we become aware that personally identifiable information from a child under 13 has been collected without such child’s parent or guardian’s consent, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.
<br><br>

<b>Other Services:</b><br>
As a convenience to you, we may provide links to third-party Services from within our Service. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites.  When you link away from our Service, you do so at your own risk.
<br><br>

<b>Changes to this Privacy Policy:</b><br>
We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this Privacy Policy at any time.  However, if at any time in the future we plan to use personally identifiable information in a way that materially differs from this Privacy Policy, including sharing such information with more third parties, we will post such changes here and provide you the opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses.  Your continued use of the Service and our services following the posting of any changes to this Privacy Policy means you accept such changes.
<br><br>

<b>Opt-Out Process:</b><br>
All unsubscribe or opt-out requests should be sent to us at hello@interfacefoundry.com and we will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. However, we are not responsible for, and in some cases we are incapable of, removing your personally identifiable information from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy or your consent.  You should contact such third parties directly.

<br><br>
Any communication or material you transmit to us by email or otherwise, including any data, questions, comments, suggestions, or the like is, and will be treated as, non-confidential and nonproprietary.
