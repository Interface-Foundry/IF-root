To set up a dev repl set:

1. edit the paths in the *.yaml files to be whatever you want on your computer
2. edit start.sh to be wherever the instance of mongod you want to use lives
3. run start.sh
4. tail the log files and fix whatever didn't work
5. run start.sh
6. tail the log files and fix whatever didn't work
7. run start.sh
8. tail the log files and fix whatever didn't work
9. run start.sh

or at least that's what worked for me.
